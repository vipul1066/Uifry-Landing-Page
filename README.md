# Responsive Website

This is a responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design ensures it looks great on devices of all sizes, using modern web design principles and accessibility best practices. Key technologies include HTML5 for structure, CSS3 (with Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries) for responsive styling, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. To run the project locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
